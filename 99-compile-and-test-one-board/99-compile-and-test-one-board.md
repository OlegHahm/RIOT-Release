Summary
=======

This test is an optional extension to increase test coverage. It indicates that
we should run test 02 for as many boards as possible. It compiles all
applications and tests, and automatically runs all tests that only require the
board.

Task #01 - Run test 02 on additional hardware
=============================================

### Description

Can be done multiple times for different boards.

Compile all applications and run tests when available on a given board.
Run `../02-tests/compile_and_test_for_board.py` script with your test board
connected.

See `../02-tests/02-tests.md` and script `--help` for usage.

Please make the result files available to the release manager.
